Like thousands of other British children of immigrants, he knows very little about the land where his parents came from. As his mother Shanthi says - he's a coconut. Sri Lankan on the outside, but British on the inside. \n\nNow Shanthi wants her son to connect to his roots - so she's decided to change all that by sending Romesh on an odyssey around the motherland. Not that he's that happy about it.\n\nIn the final episode, Shanthi heads out to Sri Lanka to join Romesh and find out what he's learnt. Romesh does his best to bluff his way through as a tour guide before the pair of them try to join the family business of arranged marriage brokers. In exchange for Romesh having a go at a traditional Sri Lankan sports day, he asks his mum to take part in a rap video with local Sri Lankan rap group Colombo MBZ. \n\nHaving now spent six weeks in his mother's homeland, the real issue is now whether Romesh will come clean about all the things he hasn't done. Can he make it up to her? And, most importantly, will he be able to make her proud of him?",
